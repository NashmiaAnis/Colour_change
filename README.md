# Colour_change
Introducing My Project, a color-changing app that showcases the use of set intervals to change the background color. When the start button is pressed, the background color begins to change, and when the stop button is pressed, the color stops changing. It's an innovative and interactive way to demonstrate the use of intervals in app development.
